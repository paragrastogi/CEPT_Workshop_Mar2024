    "<h2>Problem Statement</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider a real estate transaction: someone is buying an existing building or set of buildings from someone else. Call the buildings being purchased an \"asset\". So, we have at least two stakeholders: a buyer and a seller. It is quite common for the buyer and sellers of buildings, i.e., past and new owners, to the lease or rent the building out to occupiers. The occupiers may be companies for offices, residents for flats, institutions, retail/shops, etc. Finally, there may be banks or financial institutions who finance the transaction for the new owner, e.g., a home loan or commercial loan against property (mortgage). These are the stakeholders who own, use, and operate a building. Some specialists might be part of the picture as well, such as facilities managers, utility companies (water, electricity, gas, internet, etc.), security providers, and others. Finally, there is you: the architect or engineer. What role do you play?\n",
    "\n",
    "Real estate transactions do not, conventionally, consider the energy or environmental performance of a building or asset. This creates an \"assymetry\" of information between the seller and the buyer. This asymettry could have some undesirable outcomes, such as: \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>the new owner is unable to plan their energy expenditure</li>\n",
    "<li>the asset may already violate local energy or pollution laws, or be in danger of doing so in the near future</li>\n",
    "<li>the asset may be in danger of getting \"stranded\", i.e., its energy and emissions will exceed the limits set by a reasonable, time-defined path to net zero, and there will be limited to no options to sufficiently reduce them.</li>\n",

    "For the first exercise, we fix the inputs to typical values and use random coefficients to specify the relationship between inputs and output. The simulators you use will almost never be random - for buildings at least - so this exercise represents a lack of knowledge about the coefficients. That is to say, <i>if we don't know the relationships, then they appear random</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you run the next cell, it should give you a different set of random coefficients. This in turn means that the values of 'energy consumption' will be different for <i>exactly the same inputs</i>. Clearly, this is not possible for a real building running under the exact same conditions. If you knew the 'answer', i.e., the true energy consumption, you could run this next cell until the coefficients gave you a perfect match of predicted energy use versus measured or true energy use. That is a dumb version of regression modelling, and will show you that pure guesswork, or 'brute force' is often a wasteful means of arriving at an answer. Clever algorithms have been developed that do this faster and with less calculations."
